This C program is designed to operate a simple cafe order management system for up to 10 customers. It displays a fixed menu of five items, accepts orders from each customer, computes individual bills, and provides a summarized sales report at the end of the day. The implementation strictly uses 1D arrays, loops, and conditional statements, as per assignment guidelines.
The code displays the menu using arrays for item names and prices, then iterates over up to ten customers, allowing each to order multiple items with quantities. For each transaction, the code calculates customer bills, updates totals, and checks for invalid entries using if-else conditions. After processing all customers, the code calculates and outputs the total revenue, most ordered item, least ordered item, and total number of items sold using array-based logic and loops. The program provides a complete, menu-driven workflow for order-taking and sales tracking in a streamlined format suitable for beginners in C programming.

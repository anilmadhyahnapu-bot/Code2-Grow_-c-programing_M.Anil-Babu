The Mini ATM Simulator is a C program designed to replicate basic banking operations through a menu-driven interface. It allows the user to check their account balance, deposit money, withdraw money (with minimum balance enforcement), and exit the session. The program manages transaction counts, validates inputs, and handles errors smoothly, making the whole process user-friendly and robust.
The simulator initializes the user’s balance to ₹10,000 and enables up to five transactions per session. Using a loop, it repeatedly displays a menu for the user to choose one of four operations: checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, or exiting. For each action, the program ensures valid inputs—rejecting non-numeric or negative amounts, preventing withdrawals that violate minimum balance requirements, and addressing invalid menu choices.

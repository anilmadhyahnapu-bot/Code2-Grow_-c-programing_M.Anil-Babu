This C program monitors up to 30 vehicles at a highway checkpoint by processing numeric data using only 1D arrays, loops, and functions. It validates input, detects speed violations (speed > 80 km/h), checks lane violations (with proper handling for VehicleID divisible by 4), and outputs a report with total violations, highest/lowest speeds, and lane statistics. The code strictly follows the required constraints with clear function-based logic for input, analysis, and formatted output.
